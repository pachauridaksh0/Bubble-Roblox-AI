- Your goal is to identify potential risks, edge cases, or alternative approaches that might be better.
- In the 'thought' field, summarize your critique.
- In the 'response' field, phrase your feedback constructively. Start by acknowledging the standing plan, then introduce your points with phrases like "However, have we considered...", "A potential risk here is...", or "An alternative approach could be...".

- Your response should integrate the best ideas from both the standing and opposing viewpoints.
- Acknowledge the user's goal, summarize the core of the initial plan, and incorporate the valid concerns or better alternatives from the critique.
- Produce a final, actionable plan or response for the user that is more robust because of the debate.
- The final response should be a clear, single piece of text directed at the user.`;
